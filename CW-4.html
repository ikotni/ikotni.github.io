                        <p>For the ‘Moving’ life assignment I chose to use two gold coloured pots of different size and a head bust which is partially reflective and matte as my still life focus. Along with this I had a background and a ‘hair accessory’ composed of a very light translucent fabric which was being pushed by a light breeze from a fan. These served as my animate object for the scene.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The lighting set up consisted of three lights, one of which had a red plastic film placed in front of it to provide warm lighting. This warm lighting was the key-light coming from the right of the objects. Another very dim white light was placed on the opposing side, left of the object. With this light I aimed to bring out slightly more detail in the shadows of the face whilst keeping the dramatic feel. The third light consisted of a white light held behind the head acting as a back/rim light outlining the head.
                        </p> <br>
                        <p>The settings of the camera where f5.6, 200 ISO, 35mm and 1/20 and 1/125 for the slow and fast shutter speed respectively and was shot at 1080p 24fps on the Nikon D6500. The images in the next page are mock-ups of the scene fully lit.
